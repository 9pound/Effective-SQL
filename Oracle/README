REMINDER:
In Oracle, use CREATE SCHEMA to create a new container for application tables.  Use
CREATE DATABASE (which in the SQL standard creates a table container) to create
a new instance of the Oracle system.  You can also use CREATE USER to create a new 
named set of objects (tables, etc.) associated with a user name.  We chose to use 
CREATE USER to make is simpler to point to the required schema for a particular
set of SQL commands in the listings.
